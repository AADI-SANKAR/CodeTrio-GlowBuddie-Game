Glow Buddies is a web-based memory game designed with accessibility at its core. It provides an interactive, fun, and inclusive experience for children with diverse abilities:
    Visual impairments (blindness, low vision, color blindness)
    Hearing impairments (deafness, hard of hearing)
    Autism spectrum disorder
    Cognitive or learning disabilities (e.g., dyslexia)
    Motor impairments (e.g., limited hand mobility)


The game engages players with a simple yet rewarding memory challenge while offering customization options to cater to their specific needs.



How It Works
     The interface displays four large colorful buttons labeled A, B, C, and D.
     When the user clicks Start, a sequence of buttons lights up accompanied by sound cues.
     The player must repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.
     On successful completion,They get a motivational voice feedback and they move on to the next level.
     Players are given three tries per level, and the voice assistant provides  updates and encouragement.
     The Reset button allows restarting the game at any point.



  Key Accessibility Features

  High Contrast Mode – Enhances visibility for low vision or color-blind users. Buttons also glow when clicked, aiding players who struggle to distinguish            colors and those who have poor vision. 
  
   Sound Toggle – Allows hearing-impaired players or those who prefer silence to turn off sound cues.
   Calm Mode – Slows the sequence to give players more time to memorize patterns — ideal for slower cognitive processing.
    Voice Assistant – Offers verbal instructions, feedback, and encouragement for players who benefit from auditory guidance.
    Large Buttons – Easy to press and designed for single clicks, making the game accessible for children with limited mobility or dexterity.
